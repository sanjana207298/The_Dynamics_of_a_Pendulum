# The_Dynamics_of_a_Pendulum
This Github repository focuses on simulating various types of pendulums with a goal of exploring the effects of varying different parameters and identifying the conditions that lead to chaotic behavior. Some of the simulations are compared with experimental data to validate the findings.
